        <h2>Research Structure</h2>
          <p>For this research project, I plan to conduct a series of interviews with a variety of native Arabic speakers and their children who live around the country. I plan to ask about participants’ linguistic habits and comfort in speaking Arabic in public both before and after 9/11. I plan to focus on three main groups: older native Arabic speakers who were alive and living in the United States both before and after 9/11 (both migrants and older children of migrants who learned Arabic as their first language); the children of native Arabic speakers who have lived most or all of their lives in post-9/11 America; and native Arabic speakers who have migrated to the United States post-9/11 with long-term residency plans. I believe interviewing these groups will provide a good picture of how changing attitudes and Islamophobia post-9/11 have impacted linguistic expression among native Arabic-speaking communities and their children.</p>
          <p>I hope to find at least 20 participants from around the United States from each of these groups and conduct interviews that are on average half an hour with each participant, but the time is expected to fluctuate depending on how much each participant decides to share. The number of participants may also fluctuate depending on the regions participants are from, as I am seeking a more balanced regional representation.  I intend to reach out through online groups and forums, as well as through organizations that work with migrants from Arab countires.</p>
          <p>Interviews will be conducted primarily over Zoom or a similar platform, or possibly in-person for more local participants. I intend to ask a pre-prepared question set designed specifically for each of the three groups as a basis of the interviews, with any additional questions being added organically depending on and arising from the content of the participants’ answers. I intend to create intelligent transcriptions from the interview recordings and code the data to create a thematic analysis and come to my final conclusions.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of the Research Design</h2>
          <p>The benefits of these choices are that interviews give participants more freedom to contribute their own ideas and experiences to the project without boxing them into the kind of structure of a survey. Coming into the interviews with a set of basic but changeable questions allows me to learn about the specific points I’m interested in while letting participants guide the conversation as well. An intelligent transcription of each interview allows me to get all of the information that participants share in their own words while eliminating pauses and sounds like “um” in order to avoid clouding important points. As someone approaching this from the broader field of linguistics, I carefully consider how slight semantic changes can alter the meanings and intents behind statements, and I think this approach allows me to keep interview transcriptions as accurate as possible while still being readable. Choosing to code the interviews allows me to see themes and patterns in a clearer and more objective sense with my own biases coloring the findings much less.</p>
        <h2>Potential Drawbacks of the Research Design</h2>
          <p>Drawbacks of my methodological choices include the subjectivity of interviews, the unverifiability of many people’s personal experiences and memories, and the potential for the interviewer to frame their questions in ways that guide participants to a pre-assumed conclusion. Another potential issue that could arise is the varied English abilities that participants may have, as most of them will know English as a second language. For this reason, it will be important to have a skilled Arabic translator involved in the project for potential clarification of questions and answers. While interviews are a very subjective way of data collection, as this is a project that will focus in a large part on participants’ own feelings and comfort when expressing themselves linguistically in Arabic, I believe that this is not necessarily an entirely negative feature. The place where I could see this potentially arising as a problem a bit more could be in participants’ reporting of their own linguistic habits. As for the potential for the interviewer to frame questions to fit their own expectations, I intend to come into this project without predetermined expectations, ask colleagues to look over my interview questions before using them, and (if participants allow it) to make interviews available to the public for increased transparency.</p>

        <h1>Background and Review of Literature</h1>
	        <p>It is widely agreed that the events of 9/11 have led to a sharp increase in Islamophobic and anti-Arab sentiments in the United States, which has negatively impacted these populations both in the US and around the world.</p>
	        <p>In one article, “The Impact of 9/11 and the War on Terror on Arab and Muslim Children and Families” by Selcuk R. Sirin, Elysia Choi1, and Canan Tugberk, focusing on the psychological effects of this increased Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism, the authors detail how Islamophobia has negatively impacted the mental health of Arab and Muslim children and their families.</p>
          <p>In studies relating to the use of the Arabic language specifically in the United States after 9/11, I noticed that much of it focuses on the teaching of Arabic to English speakers, and sometimes vice versa, and how this has been impacted by 9/11. One such article, “English and Arabic Post 9/11” by Mohammed Dahbi, examines how English and Arabic represent both a linguistic and cultural divide between the Western world and the Arab world. He details how teachers of English in the Arab world try and distance the language from English speakers and their culture, framing English as a utilitarian language, and how English-speaking learners of the Arabic language often go the opposite direction, learning Arabic due to curiosity to learn more about Arabs and Muslims. He concludes that both of these languages must be taught as tools for greater cultural understanding.</p>
          <p>Another article, “The Status of Arabic in the United States of America post 9/11 and the Impact on Foreign Language Teaching Programs” by Abdel-Rahman Abu-Melhim, discusses how Arabic language teaching programs have been impacted since 9/11, with encouraging findings. Abu-Melhim reports that Arabic is the fastest growing language taught in universities, largely due to curiosity and political necessity after the events of 9/11.</p>
	        </p>While I was able to find plenty of non-linguistic articles focusing on the impact of Islamophobia on Arabs and Muslims post-9/11, and language-focused articles centering on English-speakers’ experiences with the Arabic language post 9/11, I noticed a disappointing relative lack of research on the effects of Islamophobia specifically on the linguistic expression of native Arabic speakers in the United States. While there are plenty of studies on the general state of Arabic language education post 9/11, I would consider the linguistic expression and freedom of native Arabic speakers and their children and how they have been impacted to be a very distinct issue that has not received enough focus.</p>

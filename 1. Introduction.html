     <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>In this research project, I plan to study the effects that heightened Islamophobia resulting from the 9/11 attacks and ongoing wars in the Middle East has had on the linguistic expression of Arabic-speaking populations in the United States. This research project is largely rooted in the field of sociolinguistics, which examines the effects of society on language. This project will specifically examine the effects of Islamophobic discrimination on Arabic language expression and language preservation through generations. It will focus on issues of societal pressure, Islamophobic violence, and policies relating to the Arabic language (and “foreign languages” more generally) as they affect the linguistic expression of Arabic speakers.</p>
      <p>This study is important to the field of sociolinguistics because it examines the real-world effects of an ideological shift and decades-long war effort on the language expression of a linguistic minority in the United States. Cultivating an “us vs them” mentality has historically been useful propaganda to rally war support, but it’s important to examine how this tactic affects the diaspora of so-called “them” living on home soil.</p>

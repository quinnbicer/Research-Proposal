	        <p>After reviewing the topic and significance of post-9/11 Arabic language-focused sociolinguistics and the literature on this topic, I have decided to pursue the general research question: How has heightened Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism post-9/11 affected the linguistic expression of Arabic speaking communities in the United States? Narrower questions this research project will explore include: How has this discrimination affected the Arabic-language acquisition of the children of native Arabic speakers in the US? How has propaganda supporting the wars in the Middle East furthered Islamophobia and linguistic discrimination towards Arabic-speaking populations in the US? How has linguistic strain from Islamophobia evolved over time since the events of 9/11, if at all?</p>
          <p>I am entering into this research project with the hypothesis that the linguistic expression of native Arabic speakers and their children in the United States has suffered as a result of the increased hostile environment towards Muslims and Arabs since 9/11. If my hypothesis is confirmed, it will highlight how Islamophobia has touched the lives of native Arabic speakers in ways that are more subtle and insidious than physical and verbal violence towards Arabs and Muslims. It would help show the ways that Islamophobia harms not only the physical and mental well-being but also the identities and cultural/linguistic expression of Arabs in the United States. </p>
          <p>If my hypothesis is disconfirmed, it would be an encouraging testament to the resilience of native Arabic speakersâ€™ linguistic expression. However, I would expect that even if the broader trend indicates that Arabic linguistic expression has not suffered as a result of Islamophobia, that this study will reveal prevalent linguistic-related Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism nonetheless.</p>
